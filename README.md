# Neural Map

- People working in artificial intelligence often face problems when coding complex neural networks. Many of them either lack the resources or time to learn and practice the syntax and rules of programming languages. A No-Code User-friendly interface is developed to create, train, and analyze the userâ€™s neural network to address this issue

## Salient Features:

- Developing neural network with a no-code environment
- Drag and drop facility to provide the easiest way to design your network.
- By defining hyperparameters, the network can be trained.
- Tensorflow integration for better visualization and easier analysis.
- The availability of many customizable layers empowers users to construct complex networks with multiple input and output vectors.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast 

# ReactFlow

ReactFlow is a JavaScript library for building interactive flowcharts and node-based graphs using React. It provides a set of components and utilities to create and manipulate diagrams with ease.


## Features

- **Customizable**: Customize the appearance of nodes, edges, and the entire diagram to match your application's style.
- **Interactive**: Easily interact with nodes and edges through drag-and-drop, selection, and connections.
- **Responsive**: Designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices.
- **Extensible**: Extend ReactFlow with custom nodes, edges, and functionality to fit your specific requirements.
- **State Management**: Manage the state of the diagram easily using React's component-based architecture.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install ReactFlow via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-flow-renderer
# or
yarn add react-flow-renderer
